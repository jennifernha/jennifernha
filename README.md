Hi, I’m Jennifer Ha!

**Background:**
 I come from AdTech background with data analysis and visualization experience. To enrich my knowledge and technical skills, I'm currently enrolled in Flatiron Data Science program due in December 2021, learning different languages and concepts to solve problems including: regression, classification, anomaly detection, and recommender system.


**Why Data Science:**
 Data is one of the important features of every organization because it helps business leaders to make decisions based on facts, statistical numbers and trends. It is also the most reliable source in our daily lives: daily temperature in the weather app, stock market, yelp reviews, movie rating, etc. The world we now live in is inseparable from data, and the amount of information available to us will only grow. This is where I want to step in as someone who has the ability to understand the business needs, collect the necessary data, clean the dataset, create data visualization, provide analysis with meaningful insights and recommendations to help individuals, business leaders, and companies to make better decisions backed with data. 

While working as an analyst in the AdTech industry for the past few years, one of the challenges I constantly faced was my inability to go beyond my analysis, insights, and recommendations that I was already providing. I struggled to provide more in-depth analyses due to the limitation of the tools I was familiar with. For example, using SQL and Tableau was not enough to build predictive modeling when forecasting a campaign budget or expected KPI performance. In such circumstances, I was forced to rely on other analysts who are capable of utilizing other programming languages and visualization tools. 
 
To overcome such roadblocks I face from time to time, I’ve started the journey of becoming a Data Scientist to prepare myself not only to become more analytical but also to be capable of solving the problems. Those responsibilities for a Data Analyst/Scientist serve as a motivation for me to come up with the best solutions for every problem I would encounter. Knowing where my passion lies, gaining more experience in Data Science and preparing myself as a Data Scientist is one of the best decisions I've made. I wish to become a trustworthy Data Scientist who is able to identify the overarching business problem, and look at available datasets in multiple angles to provide many solutions.
